H5 data analysis:

h5_data_analysis.py allows the user to save specific sensor data to a csv file.

Using:
1. PIP install h5py and numpy
2. Specify a folder name, this folder will be created in the working directory and all sensor csv's will be saved here
3. Specify a group, all sensors within this group (including within all sub-groups) will be saved
4. Enjoy

Notes:
- For faster runtime remove h5_tree(hf)
